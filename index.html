        <p><em>inb4 "OMG U SAY SOMETHING CRITICAL OF ISLAM!?? OMG Y U HATE ALL BROWN PEOPLE OMG!!? THAT'S RAYCESS!!"</em></p>

<p><strong>Judging all adherents of a philosophy based on the actions of a handful of assholes who are also adherents of that philosophy is logically inconsistent and, moreover, douchey. OK? My beef isn't with nice people. Not exactly, anyway. I'm glad of all the people who don't kill or oppress, period, full stop, cut, print, push, compile, ship, end.</strong></p>

<p><a href="images/304.gif"><img src="images/304.gif" alt="THAT'S RACIST!"></a></p>

<p>Now that that's out of the way, I can begin.</p>

<p>With the two hostage situations currently ongoing (as of this writing) in Paris, we are for the second time this week witness to serious religiously-motivated crimes on our home turf. There are countless such crimes occurring every day, but we care about these few more because they're closer to home and involve white people as well as a sort of extra-governmental censorship that the law was powerless to prevent. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubV3t9_CwDc">Similar to the strength of our feelings about mayonnaise</a>*, white people love other white people** and hate censorship.*** This stuff gets us all worked up.</p>

<p>The growing choir of voices stridently insisting that Islam is the Religion of Peace, while well-intentioned, have completely missed the point. There are very few religions which are truly religions of peace without a significant amount of interpretive work on the part of their adherents. The sentiment would be more accurately expressed as "the manner in which I interpret my religion is a peaceful one." Those who cling tighter to their book are almost invariably more violent than those more closely aligned with the Western societal mainstream, but we rarely see the worst that religion can do in the West because society and the governments it creates would not tolerate that level of violence. Take our modern-day Western Christianity and Judaism, for example: how many believers do you know of who follow the Biblical orders**** to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+21%3A18-21&amp;amp;version=KJV">stone disobedient youths to death</a> or even to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+16%3A18&amp;amp;version=KJV">never, ever remarry after divorce</a>? Couldn't do that-- it would be inconvenient, since you'd be <a href="http://silehspamme.github.io/dafuq.html">in jail for murder</a> or <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+38%3A9&amp;amp;version=KJV">completely unable to get yourself off without committing another sin</a>. (Every sperm is sacred, after all.) Westboro Baptist, considered a prime example of modern fundamentalist Christian-themed religious intolerance, did little more than scream and wave signs obnoxiously: in this way, even they conform with Western societal norms to some extent, rather than <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+20%3A13&amp;amp;version=KJV">following the troubleshooting steps described in the manual</a>.</p>

<p><em>As an aside: why is it I have to keep saying "Western" before "societal?" It's not because I'm automatically assigning anything non-Western the status of barbarity, but rather that I don't feel I know enough about what other cultures consider norms to write about them authoritatively, and therefore I am being very specific about the societal context in which I'm working. I've lived in, and acclimated to the cultures of, three different countries for a period exceeding 4.5 years in each, but all of them were in the West. The same goes for the white people thing: I've never been anything but a white person. I can't much speak about others.</em></p>

<p>What people mean when they say they prefer "moderate" and "peaceful" religions is that they prefer people to be <em>less religious</em>. To <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking_(fallacy)">follow fewer of the prescriptions and proscriptions of their proclaimed faith.</a> To not take it as seriously. To be flexible and tolerant of dissenters, even if their deity told them not to be. <strong>Think for a moment how disingenuous that is.</strong> Do you really think you can talk your way out of Commandments-with-a-capital-C given to you by the almighty creator of the universe? Do you think that such a deity cares one bit if everyone around you decides some day that we should now all be nice to whatever person or group was, up to that point, the target of your - and his - ire?</p>

<p>Irrespective of the Charlie Hebdo attackers' status (this to be determined by society at large) as <a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/no-true-scotsman">Untrue Scotsmen of their faith</a>, from their perspective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Hebdo_shooting#Motive">the attack was made as religious revenge</a>. But I don't single out Islam for condemnation because of their motivations, any more than I condemn any other religion, philosophy, or brand of cars***** for what its fans do. Rather, I condemn religion in general, and its ability and tendency to motivate people to do things that they would not do if the majority in their ideological peer group opposed the actions. Religion is something - although certainly not the only thing - that breaks herd immunity against stupidity by subverting people's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism">tendency to do things beneficial for the group</a> by changing the criteria they use to determine beneficence. More powerful than society is, of course, deity: when your god tells you what to do, do you question, or do you act? If you believe authentically, correctly, fully, then you act without question, because God is on your side, and it's just a nice bonus that everyone around you agrees that you're acting in accordance with accepted standards for conduct. Indeed, "<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A31-39&amp;amp;version=KJV">if God be for us, who can be against us?</a>" Sing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_Hymn_of_the_Republic#Lyrics">Battle Hymn</a> and march on to victory!</p>

<p>My <a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/strawman">straw-man opponent</a> retorts, "but what Charlie Hebdo printed was intentionally offensive to Muslims!" I intentionally reply to him, "<a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ad-hominem">fuck you, you're a dick, and your grandma was a whore.</a>" I then inquire if I have offended him, and if so, if I now deserve to die more than I did before. "Of course not," I pretend he replies, "nothing justifies murder!" ...unless of course it's the creator of the universe <a href="http://quran.com/33/57-61">clearly ordering you to commit it as vengeance for a crime against him or his chosen</a>, right? You wouldn't defy a direct order from God, would you?</p>

<p>My <a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/strawman">straw-man opponent</a> replies again, "but you're just <a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/the-texas-sharpshooter">cherry-picking violent verses to paint a bad picture of religion</a> and ignoring <a href="http://quran.com/3/186">all of the ones</a> that <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+6%3A29&amp;amp;version=KJV">encourage tolerance</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Christian_charities">all</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Jewish_charities">the</a> good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Islamic_Relief_organizations">things</a> that religion does! Hell, you're even ignoring <a href="http://imgur.com/a/zd5rl/">all of the Arabic media that condemned the attack</a>!" I reply to him that it doesn't matter in this case, because my argument is that,  if your goal is to be right with your god and have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticity_(philosophy)">authentic</a> faith experience, you need to believe and act as if all of your Holy Book is the inerrant work it proclaims itself to be. If you deny that, then you're saying that your book is errant. You're throwing a part of it out. If you're correct about the reality of your god, then you are breaking a Commandment-with-a-capital-C by disregarding part of the rules, and will be punished accordingly for it. It's an all-or-nothing proposition. Go fundy or go to Hell.</p>

<p>So why do we only have two or three suspects in the Paris attacks rather than every person in France who shares their religious demonym? Because the majority of those people are good and decent, and also live <em>in</em> society with the rest of us, and <em>get it</em>, and are willing to compromise. There are probably a few who sympathise with the attackers, but are too afraid to take action because of the consequences. And then there are a couple - just two or three in the entire country, maybe - who aren't afraid to act. And act they did.</p>
